# Heart Disease Prediction

## Task Objective
To build a model that predicts whether a person is at risk of heart disease based on their health data.

## Dataset Used
- **Name:** Heart Disease UCI Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle - UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)

## Models Applied
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier

## Key Results and Findings
- Both models were trained and evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC score.
- The Decision Tree model provided clear feature importance insights.
- The most important features included age, cholesterol level, and resting blood pressure.
- The models achieved good accuracy, making them useful for initial medical risk assessment.
